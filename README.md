# Deployment_DecisionTree
## Load the dataset into your preferred data analysis environment (e.g., Python with libraries like Pandas and NumPy).
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
## Decision Tree Classification: Train the model on the training set and evaluate its performance on the testing set using appropriate evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC)
## Hyperparameter Tuning: Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize the Decision Tree model. Experiment with different hyperparameters such as maximum depth, minimum samples split, and criterion.

# Model Evaluation and Analysis:
## Analyse the performance of the Decision Tree model using the evaluation metrics obtained.
## Visualize the decision tree structure to understand the rules learned by the model and identify important features

# Deployment using streamlit
